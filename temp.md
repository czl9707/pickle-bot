# I Reunited My Cats in Code

Pickle is yelling for food right now. She does this 8PM everyday.

Cookie was her step-brother. The chill one. He lives somewhere else now.

So I reunited them in code - Pickle handles the chat, Cookie handles the memories. They're still together.

Okay, enough cat story.

I built **pickle-bot** - yet another lightweight OpenClaw alternative.

OpenClaw is incredible, but I wanted to understand how agents work. So I built my own:
- Runs on Raspberry Pi
- A clean and manageable codebase
- Create agents, add skills, schedule crons
- Chat via CLI, Telegram, Discord
- Web Search, API server, all good stuff.

**Chatting with "Pickle" while Pickle yells at me? Just so much fun.**

Pickle is mine. Bring your own cats :)
